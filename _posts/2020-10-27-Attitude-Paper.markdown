I'm happy to share that our paper titled "Measuring the Impact of Influence on Individuals: Roadmap to Quantifying Attitude" has been accepted for publication at the 2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM). 

In this paper, we introduce models and algorithms to aid strongly influencing users in social networks. This work is done in collaboration with Xiaoyun Fu, Raj Gaurav Kumar, Dr. Shawn Dorius, Dr. Samik Basu, and Dr. Pavan Aduri.

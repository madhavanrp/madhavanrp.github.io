Happy to share that I've been presented the 2018 John Vincent Atanasoff Award. This is an annual award that is awarded to 1 of 193 graduate students in recognition of academic and research performance.

I'm very thankful to Dr. Samik Basu, Dr. Pavan Aduri and the Computer Science Department at Iowa State University!

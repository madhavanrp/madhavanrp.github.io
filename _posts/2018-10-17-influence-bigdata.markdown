I'm delighted to share that our paper titled "Influence Maximization in Social Networks With Non-Target Constraints" has been accepted to appear in IEEE BigData 2018. This paper introduces the Constrained Influence Maximization Problem: How to influence users in social networks while simultaneously limiting the number of adversarial "Non-Target" users that are influenced.

This paper is co-authored with Naresh Somisetty, Samik Basu, and Pavan Aduri.

# Targeted Influence Maximization
In social networks, it is often the case that we need to spread ideas and influence through the network. For this to succeed, individual nodes with high influence should be identified so as to maximize the influence spread. This is the Influence Maximization problem. In Targeted Influence Maximization, we want to find influential nodes that maximize the influence to one set of "Target" users, while maintaining the number of "Non Targets" influenced below a threshold number.
